        <h1>Gradients: the colorful design trend aiming to soothe these anxious times</h1>
        <h2>Here’s why The Daily, Coachella, and Facebook all use backgrounds that look like a sunset.</h2>

        <p>This is some text</p>
        <p>Welcome to Noticed, The Goods’ design trend column. You know that thing you’ve been seeing all over the place? Allow us to explain it.</p>
        <p>What it is: A digital or print effect where one color fades into another. Typically rendered in soft or pastel tones.
        <p>Where it is: Gradients are seemingly everywhere in media and marketing. They are part of a suite of Facebook status backdrops introduced in 2017 and the branding for the New York Times’ popular podcast The Daily, which displays a yellow to blue gradient.</p>
        <p>Gradients have taken over Coachella’s app and website (if you watch carefully, the colors shift). Ally’s billboard in A Star Is Born is a full-on gradient, and so was the branding for the Oscars ceremony that recognized Lady Gaga.</p>
        <p>On Instagram, they provide a product backdrop for popular Korean beauty brand Glow, and have been embraced by indie magazines Gossamer and Anxy — both designed by Berkeley studio Anagraph.</p>
        <p>On the luxury front, Brooklyn wallpaper company Calico has released an entire collection of gradient wallpapers called Aurora. Meanwhile, Spanish fashion house Loewe has introduced a version of their trendy Elephant bag in a spectrum of pink to yellow.</p>
